# 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

## Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.

A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

## Requirements

### General

You can post your blog post on the platform of your choice, LinkedIn or Medium are good ones
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Growing up, there was this fancy thing always hanging there on my mind when I watched older folks who were computer literates then, or have been exposed to the world of Computers and computing, using a digital computer or smart devices to surf the internet and one of them was entering a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) on the address bar of a browser and when the Enter/Return key was pressed: BOOM! Somany information and resource materials are being displayed as an output. I was curious and wanted to know what was going on behind the scene in that little brain box (CPU) or rather what was going on as well as the technology (software, hardware, networks and infrastructures) behind it.

In this era where we have digital migrants and digital natives co-existing as well as having access to the internet with most gadgets, digital and electronic devices having access to the internet, we might have typed in the URL address `www.google.com`` into the address bar of any browser (Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, etc.) on our Smartphones, laptops, and desktops and when we hit the Enter/Return button on our hard or soft keyboards, or click on the Google search button, a whole lot of information and resources are shown to us for us to make our right choices and we wonder what happens within those few seconds before our search results from Google are displayed.
